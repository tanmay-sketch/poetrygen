It lies five miles,Straight away through the mountain notch,"From the sink window where I wash the plates,","And all our storms come up toward the house,",Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and,whiter.,It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit,To step outdoors and take the water dazzle,"A sunny morning, or take the rising wind","About my face and body and through my wrapper,","When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,",And a cold chill shivered across the lake.,"I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,",Our Willoughby!
