Voice Porter – A Poem for Indigo,For nothing more than the Love of my people,I fight,staying my path,honoring the ancestors,dragging the children to freedom with the passion of the Christ,because even as a child You freed my mind,and I Love Your imperfections,the way You colored outside the lines,though Your artwork didn’t win any prizes,as an adult Your heart’s work saves lives,and touches souls unknown even to You,and it pleases God to see You do what You do,because the truth isn’t always what’s said,but in the hand’s work,and no matter what comes and goes,He will be edified through man’s work,and You,You’ve done a lion’s share,tending the fields and feeding His sheep until Your hands hurt,what more can we ask for?,from the time they leave it in the morning,’til after the Sun cries,and Your knees hit the floor,and I beseech thee,take a few moments of time to teach these others,who only pretend and fall short,because their work wasn’t from the heart,they were monetarily motivated from the start,but from the moment that I opened my eyes,there You were right where You’ve always been,with me looking for the truth so hard,making it hard to find it,but here You stand,and I’ll believe in You from now until judgment call,I pray that I’ll have from now until then to figure out a title to give You,because You are more than a friend,I’m prepared to be the same to You from now until the end,perpetually moving through life cycles until my life cycle ends,these might be my last days,this poem might be my last peace,so I’ve got to speak my peace,because this piece could very well be my eulogy,in the back of my mind thoughts of You cascade down like waterfalls,as water falls against glass,and drops from my lash,becomes streams on my cheeks,and puddles in my palms,for the celestial being You are,I give alms to Him,and pray that I receive ilm forthright
